Learning Through Langgraph Chatbot : Developed a workflow, with external search tools [tavily_search and wikisearch and human_assistance]

1) Create a basic graph, with a simple chatbot node, which queries the llm
2) Create a StateGraph and add messages and other attributes for the graph state
3) Use tools, explored langchain tools here! (tavily_search and wiki_search), and added them together in the array
4) Call the llm using groq, and then bind the llm with the tools, with llm.bind_tools() function
5) Most Importat : BaseToolNode : Saw how a tool node works, and then used the prebuilt ToolNode to get all the tools in one node
6) Explored the tools_condition from langgraph.prebuilt, which is used to create a conditional edge from the llm calling node, to the tool node
7) Create edges using the graph builder
8) Create nodes using the graph builder
9) Add memory checkpoint (add local memory) to the chatbot
10) compile the graph with memory
11) Stream the graph to check and run the workflow'
12) Added an extra tool, with interrupt and Command from langgraph.types module, for human intervention in the Chatbot
